# Rune Translator #
This is a simple python script to convert english to unicode runes.<br>
The runes of choice for the letters j and k where added in unicode version 11 which is not widely used at this time so I'm using ᛃ and ᚲ instead.<br>
<br>
You can change the translation to any rune you want in the csv file.<br>
