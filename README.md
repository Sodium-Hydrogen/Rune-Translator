# Substitution Cipher #
#### This is a simple python script to convert English to another format via dictionaries. ####
I currently only have the runic dictionary made.<br>
The runes of choice for the letters j and k where added in Unicode version 11 which is not widely used at this time so I'm using ᛃ and ᚲ instead, unlike Tolkien's runic language.<br>
I've also created a base 10 counting system using runic symbols.<br>
<br>
You can change the translation to any rune you want in the `runes.csv` file.<br>
